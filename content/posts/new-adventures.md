From time to time I get the feeling that I need to do something new. Most of the time this happens when I'm either bored or 
just not satisfied with my current situation. 
I think at the moment its a bit of both. 
Dont get me wrong! I have lots of stuff to do and a lot of projects to work on in my freetime. May it be my house that needs more
renovations or some tech project that I'm currently planning. 
There is plenty to do, but somehow I feel dissatisfied with my current situation. 
I feel like I need a restart. A Reboot. A new beginning.
I think I can pull this off.

Starting by refreshing the design of this blog and making it more visible to the public.

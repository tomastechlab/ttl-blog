Just a quick heads up for everybody who it may concern. Which is basically just me and nobody else.
I changed the hosting for this blog.
It is now not longer hosted in the woods, but it still is.
What I mean by that is that I moved the blog over to github pages. This is nice and convinient to make sure
the blog stays up even if my homelab is down.
But if for any reason (i dont know why but just in case) github pages are not reachable the domain falls back to
my local hosting. Therefore, I will connect to my blog from my local connection and everybody else will
come through github.
Why?
Because I wanted to try it. Thats it. No big reason. As always.

Imagine the following: You have a small house on your property. Not a full house you can live in, more like a bigger garden shed or a small pool house (without the pool....yet).

Got it? Alright. This is what I am working with. Or better: This is where I am working in.

So far this small space was used as a party room / private pub. Including everything, you can image.
Fridge, Bar, Stools, Table... and everything in a cozy pub like lighting.
Seemed nice and I really liked it, but it is time for something new.

People who know me also know that I like to work from home A LOT.
And up until recently I worked from my kitchen table. Day in, day out.
In the last few weeks I felt that this was not sufficient anymore. I got distracted easily. I didn't get any work done, and I always had something else on my mind.
I needed a dedicated working space in my home.
Due to the lack of rooms in my house, the only option I saw was to remove everything from the garden shed and move in with my office equipment.
What does that include? Almost everything that is tech related...
My Server, my 3D Printer, Network Appliances and Equipment.

I just started.

Moved everything out of the room and replaced it with "nicer" stuff.
A cozy black couch, a new dark wooded Desk, shelves in the same color as the desk, moved in my 3d Printer "cage", put my home lab server in the corner and placed my Raspberry Pi cluster on top of it.
And so far... it looks good, and I really like it.
The best part about it is that I have a dedicated place to work again.
And it shows! The first week I worked there, I crushed pretty much every task that I got handed for the next 2-week sprint. Now I am a constant visitor of the backlog.
It feels great to have a sense of productivity again. Being able to focus fully was something that I missed. And it showed me that I am able to accomplish more than I thought.

When I started programming I learned C, C++ and Java. These languages have been around for decades and are still not fully replaceable by modern languages.
I know, I know.. the Rust, Zig and Go folks are already grabbing their pitchforks but heare me out for a second.
As programming languages evolve and make programming in itself more accessible (and even more fun) to a lot of people. 
There are still areas where the old school, rock solid seniors are needed. And I mean that in the best way possible. 
Even though I learned all these languages and their features, some quirks and the mindsets/ideas behind them, I still like more modern approaches
to languages. 
But this entry is titled "Adventures in Go" and up until now I only mentioned it once. Just keep reading and I will reveal my plan to you, just like a classic James Bond villain.
I wrote a lot of Code in my time as a software engineer and did it in various languages. Understanding the groundwork that C, C++ and Java did to 
make the "new" languages possible helped me a ton in understanding the languages I was using over the years.
Some things were easier than others, but all in all I got done what was needed at the time.
One language that always had a special place in my heart is Go.
I dont know what it is that Go is able to scratch in the back of my head that others like Python, TypeScript or others cant.
I really dont write much Code in Go. In fact I wouldnt even consider myself a Go Developer at all. I wrote some small scripts and utilities but thats it.

Therefore I decided to write a little more Go. Just a little. But it should be fun. And I want to be guided a bit with the freedom to make my own choices in the process. 
So what is the project I chose? Of course its a game. 
Introducing project "Plainwalker" an adventure RPG written in Go.
Yes, I am writing a game in Go using raylib as the framework. No Unity, no Unreal, no Godot. Just Go code => Videogame. For why I chose this path would be an entry on its own. So maybe I will write about it. We will see. 
I dabbled in game dev in C and C++ before, but this was (as already mentioned) in the old days.
I am curious how the ecosystem of game making evolved when I dont use a graphical editor where I can point and click at objects to manipulate their state and behaviour.

For the game itself I chose a genre that I'm most familiar with. RPG. Yeah.. I know. Its a broad field but as I grew up I played Legend of Zelda, Secret of Evermore, Secret of Mana and of course all the Final Fantasy games that I could get my hands on. 
These games stick to me even until today so I want to create something that reminds me of them.
The goal is not to create the next big hit. I probably wont ever release it. Its just for me to learn more Go, do some development outside of my regular work as a web developer and maybe create something that I can enjoy.

Depending on how it goes I will try to write about my progress and maybe distribute a few builds to gather feedback.

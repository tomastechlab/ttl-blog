Do you kow the feeling when you think you have figured out something but then you are completely wrong about it and then realize that if you had been more coreful in the first place you could have prevented it?

That just happened to me.
Nothing big, just an oversight. An obvbious one.
As you might know (or not) I bought an old House a few years ago. And my mission with it is to make it smart. Piece by piece, little by little.
So far so good. I pull network cables, I configure appliances, add them to my Home Assistant Network... and all works great.
Mostly, sometimes, if I care enough about it.
As I also run my own AI RIG at home I try to make it "understand" certain phrases and trigger speicif routines. But all that is beside the point.

I just ordered my second doorbell. Yes, a second one. Why? Because apparently PoE does not mean WiFi enabled.
Obviously huh? But in my mind I was sure that this doorbell that I ordered will flawlessly connect to the rest of my network and I can use its integrated camera to see who is at the door even if I'm not at home.
But then again PoE does not mean WiFi enabled. And why is that important? Because I can pull ethernet cables around the house all day long and how I want, but the one place I cant reach is the front door.
This means -> no PoE at the door. No PoE Doorbell. But WiFi reception is pretty good there!

YES!! IF I HAD A WIFI ENABLED DOORBELL!!! BUT! I! DONT!
BECAUSE I CANT READ PROPERLY!

Sorry for screaming. So... I had to order a different one. This time the correct one. Hopefully.
If not. I leave it dumb and I just point a security cam at the door from a different angle.
We will se how this will end

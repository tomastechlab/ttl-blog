Guess what happened.
I got "fired" from my government project. Well, its not really fired. I was on probation for 6 months and at the end of this 6 months they decided that I wasnt good enough (I guess??).

The thing is, I dont really know why the let me go.
I asked for reasons twice and didnt get an answer.
Its okay, from my side, as I didnt really liked the work and the environment anyway, but I would really like to know what
the real reason was that lead them to the decision that I have to leave.
Someone said it was due to my code quality or lack of standards, but in my (most likely biased) opinion.
There was no such thing as lacking code quality or lack of standards in my work.

If I have to guess what the real reason was, I would say that my workstyle was not matching with theirs.
I tried to make sure that their requirements are met and even hold back (a lot, and I mean A LOT) of code so that the
project managers and such can decide on if the requirements are done.
I did this to quickly push out the features that they wanted after they decided on what they need.
But I dont really think that this was the issue.

I think what really was messing with them was that I had my own opinion on things. If I thought something was stupid, I said so.
Maybe not that direct but I rarely hold back my opinion on things or workflows.
Dont get me wrong, I wasnt complaining all the time. I even tried to push things in directions where all developeres would benefit from the output.

But then I got told that I am too fast.
People in governmental positions are slow.
They take their time.
And they dont care about efficiency at all.

I cant say that I am sad to leave this project. I still wait on someone to offer me a conversation on why I was let go, but I bet this will not happen.
Until then, I will go back focusing on other (new) projects and maybe I can even take some time to work on my personal stuff again.

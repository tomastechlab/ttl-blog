I already wrote about my decision to start something fresh. Something new. Something fun.

And today I did the first step for that. It does not seem much but from now on its real.
As I have to get everything in order with the German government because... taxes I guess.
I started today by filing for a new tax ID and verified myself for a new bank account.
This is a very weird endeavor that someone that wants to start working in Germany needs to do.
The Country itself isn't so bad I think.
But the bureaucratic hoops one has to go through just because he/she wants to work in this country is sometimes very ridiculous.
I just learned the other day that you are not allowed to create a company and work for 0 bucks just because you love what you do.
Okay 0 bucks would be very strange but even if you don't earn as much as someone else (the finance department) decides you should, your company can get shut down.
I really don't know why it is like this but its real and its somewhat nuts.

Nonetheless, I did the first steps to officially create tomastechlab and I couldn't be more excited!

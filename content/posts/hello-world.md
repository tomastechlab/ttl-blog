Hello and welcome to my first entry! As I have no idea what to write in this first post I would like to thank you.

Yes, thank you! 

The fact that you found this Blog, and read this, tells me that you might be interested in something I wrote about or just scraped
the Internet hard enough to find a link to this post. 
Anyway, while you are here, why dont you check out my [about]({{< ref "/about" >}} "about") page? 
Or any other post I might have published since I wrote these lines.

In  any case I hope you enjoy your time here. And if you might have any questions, feel free to contact me.

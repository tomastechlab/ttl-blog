Do you remember when I wrote about my new office? Yeah... its coming together. The latest addition just arrived today.
A chair. Yes, a chair.
But what did I use before you might ask. Well, a yoga ball. Yes, I am one of those people. Having a yoga ball, using it as a chair.
But I really needed it. It was good for my back and kept my hips movable. In addition to being able to raise the desk and work standing. It's a really great way to replace a chair.
But why do I get a chair now if I am so glad that I could use the ball?
The real reason? I want something to support my back, after a few hours. As it is getting colder, and I have some arthritis related problems (yes it runs in the family, I'm not THAT old, I swear)
I need something to get a bit more comfortable in.
So I got a chair at a local furniture store, assembled it at home and am happy that I did that.

I also started switching my Development Environment. Don't worry, I won't rip apart everything I did to the shed and rebuild it (that's for a later time in my life)
but I switched from GNOME as my Desktop Environment to Sway as my Window Manager.
Why? Efficiency. I used other Tiling Window Managers before. Some for longer, some just to try them and switch back after 10 minutes.
I lastly used GNOME because it's a complete package. Nothing to worry about. Install it, start it, boom Desktop. That's nice and it works. But it is not *mine* of course I customized it, of course I installed extensions to it.
But it never felt quite complete or satisfying to use. Don't get me wrong. I got my work done with relative ease. All the tools I need work and I don't have to worry about anything really.
But I still have the ick to make it mine, and therefore I decided to switch, once again, to a tiling window manager. Something about having full control over what my User Interface does and how it behaves is really satisfying because if I don't like it, I can simply change it. And this is what I do. I currently have a good setup that works for me now. I am faster in navigating and using my system than ever before all while it uses less resources than before because I only have running what I need.
It's a great feeling. I can tell you that.

I am considering on releasing my dotfiles, as I am searching for a way that works for me to back them up somewhere and also restore them with relative ease.
Furthermore, I know there are a lot of options for this case, but I haven't found one that fully satisfies my needs on that. Maybe I even write my own dotfile manager. I bet that would be frustrating and fun with all kinds of edge-cases.
But for now I will check what's out there, try maybe a few options and possibly settle on one of the many solutions that were build by people with a lot more knowledge and skill than me.

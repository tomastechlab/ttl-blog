Yesâ€¦ you read that right. I want to do it in public.
And therefore I started publishing some of my scripts and projects on GitHub.

Not what you expected? Why? What were you thinking?

I recently started to create some repos on GitHub where I put some of my work. By far not all.
If I release everything I have in my code folder, there would be somewhere around 50-60 repos. I honestly don't know how much it really is.
But from now on I want to publish some more of my stuff on GitHub for others to see and maybe use.
I most likely won't respond to issues, except there is something major.
Most of the things you can find there are working for me.

## inofficial Disclaimer
The scripts and tools I publish are working for me. There is no guarantee that they will work for you too.
If they do, good for you, if they don't, it's up to you to figure it out.

If you would like to check out my stuff head over to [my GitHub account](https://github.com/tomastechlab)
Probably most of it will be web dev stuff, some Shell scripts and maybe some tooling in go or python.
I am not sure what I will put there, I will treat it as a backup space and maybe to showcase some stuff.

If I do a showcase you can expect a Blog post to accompany it as well.

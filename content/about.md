Hello and welcome(again I guess). I'd like to say that isnt my first rodeo. In fact I already started a few blogs in my past.
But as life goes on I never committed fully to one. Hopefully this time it will be different :) 

Usually in this section of the Blog I tell all about who the author is (thats ME!) and what the blog will be about.
I would like to stick to that tradition but also try to keep it as vague as possible because, honestly, I really
have no idea what will end up on here. 
Most likely it will be tech-related stuff. Things like programming, web development, 3d printing, general concepts etc.
Just a bunch of things that I think about and like to write something about.
Maybe I will throw in an occasional diary-like entry or maybe some DnD stuff.

And here are some things about me that I think might be interesting to someone who wants to read my blog.
I'm Tomas (yes without h, no I'm not polish or spanish), born and raised in Germany since 1989.
I'm a husband, father, CTO and co-founder of Codezilla IT-Consulting, a web-development and IT consulting company.
I have a formal education as a developer and have worked for several years in various roles and companies in web-development and e-commerce.
Besides my professional work I like to create small projects on the side that may end up here too. Maybe not. We will see.

If you feel that I might have missed some crucial information about me that needs to be added here or if you have questions,
remarks or need help with any of the things I write about, feel free to reach out.
Easiest for me would be E-mail: info (at) tomastechlab.com

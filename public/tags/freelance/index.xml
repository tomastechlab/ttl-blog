      <description>&lt;p&gt;I already wrote about my decision to start something fresh. Something new. Something fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And today I did the first step for that. It does not seem much but from now on its real.&#xA;As I have to get everything in order with the German government because&amp;hellip; taxes I guess.&#xA;I started today by filing for a new tax ID and verified myself for a new bank account.&#xA;This is a very weird endeavor that someone that wants to start working in Germany needs to do.&#xA;The Country itself isn&amp;rsquo;t so bad I think.&#xA;But the bureaucratic hoops one has to go through just because he/she wants to work in this country is sometimes very ridiculous.&#xA;I just learned the other day that you are not allowed to create a company and work for 0 bucks just because you love what you do.&#xA;Okay 0 bucks would be very strange but even if you don&amp;rsquo;t earn as much as someone else (the finance department) decides you should, your company can get shut down.&#xA;I really don&amp;rsquo;t know why it is like this but its real and its somewhat nuts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know, the title is strange. 3D Printing with 10mm accuracy doesn&amp;rsquo;t really sound that nice does it?&#xA;And in reality, its really not. But this is what is currently happening on my Ender 3v2.&#xA;I just recently converted it to a direct-drive and upgraded the firmware to the latest version.&#xA;So far so good. The upgrades went smooth and my first testprint was due.&#xA;But then it happened. I got the infamous M112 Error.&#xA;For anybody unintiated, M112 is basically the equivalent of a fatal error.&#xA;It stops everything immediately to prevent any damage from happening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

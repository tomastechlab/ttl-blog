      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guess what happened.&#xA;I got &amp;ldquo;fired&amp;rdquo; from my government project. Well, its not really fired. I was on probation for 6 months and at the end of this 6 months they decided that I wasnt good enough (I guess??).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I dont really know why the let me go.&#xA;I asked for reasons twice and didnt get an answer.&#xA;Its okay, from my side, as I didnt really liked the work and the environment anyway, but I would really like to know what&#xA;the real reason was that lead them to the decision that I have to leave.&#xA;Someone said it was due to my code quality or lack of standards, but in my (most likely biased) opinion.&#xA;There was no such thing as lacking code quality or lack of standards in my work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my 10+ years of working in the IT industry, I have worked for a number of government IT suppliers.&#xA;Wether it be government departments directly or suppliers or agencies for governement IT services.&#xA;I had some insight in how these parts of the government operate and why they do things the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to introduce this by saying that I have worked with these departments and agencies but still only had&#xA;insight in scoped projects. Which is a good thing on the one hand but means that everything I&amp;rsquo;m about to write here&#xA;needs to be taken with a grain of salt as all of this might not apply to other parts of government projects, agencies, suppliers etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

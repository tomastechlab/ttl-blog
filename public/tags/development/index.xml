      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my 10+ years of working in the IT industry, I have worked for a number of government IT suppliers.&#xA;Wether it be government departments directly or suppliers or agencies for governement IT services.&#xA;I had some insight in how these parts of the government operate and why they do things the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to introduce this by saying that I have worked with these departments and agencies but still only had&#xA;insight in scoped projects. Which is a good thing on the one hand but means that everything I&amp;rsquo;m about to write here&#xA;needs to be taken with a grain of salt as all of this might not apply to other parts of government projects, agencies, suppliers etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me start this entry with a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you program?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you program for long sessions?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you know &amp;ldquo;The Flow&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can answer all of these with a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; then you probably know the rush that comes with &amp;ldquo;The Flow&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Full-focused tunnel vision.&#xA;Just you and your code.&#xA;Its one symbiotic relationship.&#xA;Just a plain beautiful and peaceful state to be in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, most of the time at least. Did you know that you can reach this kind of focus by being angry?&#xA;The tunnel vision, the rush, the pump that shakes your whole body when fight-or-flight instincts kick in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

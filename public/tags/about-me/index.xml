      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of 2023 I bought a house and was pretty happy about it.&#xA;The house wasnt anything special but it has enough rooms to house me, my wife and my daughter.&#xA;The biggest issue however was that the man that lived here before us was a heavy smoker. And I mean a real heavy smoker.&#xA;So the walls and all the interior was basically soaked in nicotin.&#xA;So the only reasonable thing to do was to rip out basically anything and replace it with something new and fresh.&#xA;While I planned on how to achieve a home that I can live in for longer than just a few years a thought came to mind which was&#xA;basically: Why not make it smart if I have to renovate everything anyway?&#xA;And so it started.&#xA;But first I had so clarify some things:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me start this entry with a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you program?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you program for long sessions?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you know &amp;ldquo;The Flow&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can answer all of these with a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; then you probably know the rush that comes with &amp;ldquo;The Flow&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Full-focused tunnel vision.&#xA;Just you and your code.&#xA;Its one symbiotic relationship.&#xA;Just a plain beautiful and peaceful state to be in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, most of the time at least. Did you know that you can reach this kind of focus by being angry?&#xA;The tunnel vision, the rush, the pump that shakes your whole body when fight-or-flight instincts kick in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

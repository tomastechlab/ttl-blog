      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me start this entry with a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you program?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you program for long sessions?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you know &amp;ldquo;The Flow&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can answer all of these with a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; then you probably know the rush that comes with &amp;ldquo;The Flow&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Full-focused tunnel vision.&#xA;Just you and your code.&#xA;Its one symbiotic relationship.&#xA;Just a plain beautiful and peaceful state to be in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, most of the time at least. Did you know that you can reach this kind of focus by being angry?&#xA;The tunnel vision, the rush, the pump that shakes your whole body when fight-or-flight instincts kick in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started programming I learned C, C++ and Java. These languages have been around for decades and are still not fully replaceable by modern languages.&#xA;I know, I know.. the Rust, Zig and Go folks are already grabbing their pitchforks but heare me out for a second.&#xA;As programming languages evolve and make programming in itself more accessible (and even more fun) to a lot of people.&#xA;There are still areas where the old school, rock solid seniors are needed. And I mean that in the best way possible.&#xA;Even though I learned all these languages and their features, some quirks and the mindsets/ideas behind them, I still like more modern approaches&#xA;to languages.&#xA;But this entry is titled &amp;ldquo;Adventures in Go&amp;rdquo; and up until now I only mentioned it once. Just keep reading and I will reveal my plan to you, just like a classic James Bond villain.&#xA;I wrote a lot of Code in my time as a software engineer and did it in various languages. Understanding the groundwork that C, C++ and Java did to&#xA;make the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; languages possible helped me a ton in understanding the languages I was using over the years.&#xA;Some things were easier than others, but all in all I got done what was needed at the time.&#xA;One language that always had a special place in my heart is Go.&#xA;I dont know what it is that Go is able to scratch in the back of my head that others like Python, TypeScript or others cant.&#xA;I really dont write much Code in Go. In fact I wouldnt even consider myself a Go Developer at all. I wrote some small scripts and utilities but thats it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

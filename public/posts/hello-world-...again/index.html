      <p>So.. here we go again I guess. This isnt my first rodeo. In fact I already started a few blogs in my past.
But as life goes on I never committed fully to one. Hopefully this time it will be different :)</p>
<p>Usually the first post of a new Blog is all about who the author is (yey, thats ME!) and what the blog will be about.
And I would like to stick to that tradition but also try to keep it as vague as possible because, honestly, I really
have no idea what will end up on here.
Most likely it will be tech-related stuff. Things like programming, web development, 3d printing, general concepts etc.
Just a bunch of things that I think about and like to write something about.
Maybe I will throw in an occasional diary-like entry or maybe some DnD stuff.</p>
<p>And here are some things about me that I think might be interesting to someone who wants to read my blog.
I&rsquo;m Tomas (yes without h, no I&rsquo;m not polish or spanish), born and raised in Germany since 1989.
I&rsquo;m a husband, father, CTO and co-founder of Codezilla IT-Consulting, a web-development and IT consulting company.
I have a formal education as a developer and have worked for several years in various roles and companies in web-development and e-commerce.
Besides my professional work I like to create small projects on the side that may end up here too. Maybe not. We will see.</p>
<p>If you feel that I might have missed some crucial information about me that needs to be added here or if you have questions,
remarks or need help with any of the things I write about, feel free to reach out.
Easiest for me would be E-mail: <a href="mailto:tomas@tomastechlab.com">tomas@tomastechlab.com</a></p>
